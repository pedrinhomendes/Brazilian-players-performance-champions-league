# ‚öΩüèüÔ∏è Brazilian-players-performance-champions-league

Objective: Through an in-depth analysis of the players in the Champions League from 2014 to 2023, I was able to identify their performances and how they impacted matches and their outcomes, as well as analyze and predict players‚Äô market values.

## üìë Description

- This project focuses on analyzing the performance and market value trends of players in the UEFA Champions League from 2014 to 2023, with a special focus on Brazilian players.

The analysis began with significant data cleaning and preprocessing, including merging multiple datasets to ensure accuracy and consistency. Key player statistics were examined to evaluate their impact on match outcomes, as well as their contributions to goals and assists. Additionally, historical trends in player market values were analyzed, highlighting inflation, speculation, and the influence of new investors on transfer fees.

To finalize the project, machine learning models were used to predict future market values of players, providing insights into how performance data may influence market dynamics over time.

## Key Findings
- Brazilian players had a greater impact on matches than French players, despite being only half as many in the competition. Brazilian players won 65% of their matches compared to 61% for the French, recorded 204 assists versus 169, and had 451 goal involvements compared to 430.(France for having the highest number of players in the competition, but also for the overall quality of its players.)
- The top 10 Brazilian players with the best performances and impact in Champions League matches were identified, with Neymar ranked number one. He recorded a total of 56 goal involvements in 64 matches.
- There has been a significant increase in player market values, driven by factors such as inflation, speculation, and inflated transfer fees fueled by large new investors. With top players values rising by as much as 150% compared to previous years.
